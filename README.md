### Introduction
This Python notebook, [served on google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/acorbe/covid19-analytics-NL-EU/blob/master/Corona_stats_for_public.ipynb), can update itself daily with the latest data from the Netherlands [1] and from all other countries in the world [2]. The provides an example on how to perform some very basic fit to the data (i.e. the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle). It was setup by physicists, not epidemiologist. While these data may not fully represent the extent of the epidemics, making this page publicly available can potentially enable anybody interested in trying to make sense of the data and, particularly, helping assessing the effect of past and future policies.
